Hello! I'm Ganesan Santhanam, a Full Stack Software Engineer with a passion for building scalable, cloud-native applications. With 5 years of experience, I enjoy tackling complex problems with creative and sophisticated solutions, including Event-Driven Design, Microservice Architecture, and AI/ML.

I hold a Master's in Computer Science from the University of Florida and a Bachelor's in Computer Science from SRM University, India. I'm driven by a desire to learn and grow, and I'm always looking for new challenges that allow me to leverage my skills in C#, Python, and cloud technologies.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new technologies and contributing to open-source projects.
